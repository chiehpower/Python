# Marp

Marp is a very powerful tool that you can make a PPT via Markdown language.

You can easily display your program code and use latex to show the equation on your PPT, like below.

You don't need to make a PPT by Latex that sometimes it takes too much time. Marp is also supported HTML (It is optional in setting.)

If you are using VS code as well, you might wanna collect it!

I provided a sample to let you test and see how the performance is.
